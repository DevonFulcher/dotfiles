# Cursor Integration

Prompts, configuration, and docs on how I use Cursor.

## Method

Software development can progress through the following stages with corresponding rules & modes:

1. RFC - Create a high-level description of a large project.
2. Tasks - Generate and prioritize individual tasks that follow from an RFC.
3. Explore - Explore the space of options for implementing a task.
4. Plan - Propose a plan for implementing a task.
5. Code - Create a solution which follows from the plan.
6. Validate - Ensure that the implementation is production-ready.

Other rules and modes help with ad-hoc tasks:

* Documentation - Add & update documentation to classes & methods throughout the codebase.
* Test - Add & update tests to undertested parts of the codebase.
