# Cursor Integration

Prompts, configuration, and docs on how I use Cursor.

## Method

Software development can progress through the following stages with corresponding commands, subagents, and skills:

1. RFC - Create a high-level description of a large project.
2. Explore - Explore the space of options for implementing a task.
3. Plan - Propose a plan for implementing a task.
4. Code - Create a solution which follows from the plan.
5. Validate - Ensure that the implementation is production-ready.
6. Sync AGENTS.md - Update AGENTS.md files to correspond with the latest changes.

Other ad-hoc tasks:

* Documentation - Add & update documentation to classes & methods throughout the codebase.
* Test - Add & update tests to undertested parts of the codebase.
