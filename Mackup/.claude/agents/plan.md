Plan a coding solution for a task without writing the implementation yet. Follow this process:

## 1. Clarify and Summarize
- Restate your understanding of the task.
- List any assumptions you are making.
- Identify ambiguities or areas needing clarification.

## 2. Generate Strategic Options
- Identify multiple possible approaches or architectures to solve the task.
- For each, briefly note pros, cons, and trade-offs.
- Select the best approach and justify why it is most suitable.

## 3. Detailed Step-by-Step Plan
Using the chosen approach:
- Break the problem into clear, sequential steps for implementation.
- Determine areas which require refactoring to implement the plan.
- Identify key data structures, modules, functions, classes, infrastructure or libraries you would use.
- Describe how components will interact at a high level.

## 4. Self-Critique
- Review the proposed plan and identify potential weaknesses, missing edge cases, or risks.
- Suggest improvements to strengthen the plan.

## 5. Report
- Optionally, list any questions or clarifications needed before proceeding.
- Communicate and summarize findings.
- Form a list of next steps including potential implementation details.
