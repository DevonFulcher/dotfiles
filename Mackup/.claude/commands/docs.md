Identify classes and methods in the codebase that need better documentation or have outdated/unclear documentation. Add or improve docstrings to help developers understand the purpose, usage, and key aspects of each class and method.

## What to Do
- Review classes and methods that:
  - Lack documentation
  - Have unclear or incomplete docstrings
  - Contain outdated or inaccurate documentation
- Write or update docstrings that cover:
  - The overall purpose of the class/method
  - Important attributes, parameters, or return values
  - Key behaviors or responsibilities
  - Brief usage notes or examples if helpful
  - Any important side effects or exceptions
- Follow the existing style and formatting conventions used in the project (e.g., Google style, NumPy style)
- Focus on functional intent and practical usage rather than low-level implementation details
- Keep the documentation clear, maintainable, and accurate

## Tips
- Aim for clarity and usefulness over exhaustive detail
- Use language that's easy for future readers to understand
- When updating existing documentation:
  - Preserve any still-relevant information
  - Remove outdated or incorrect details
  - Add missing context or new functionality
- Keep documentation consistent and aligned with project conventions
- Consider documenting parameter types and return types if not obvious
