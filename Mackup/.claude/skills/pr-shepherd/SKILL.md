1. Review the PRs I have open. Ignore PRs in archived repos.
2. Determine which of these PRs are a bit stuck:
  - Merge conflicts
  - Minor nit comments
  - Easily fixable CI failures
3. Address these issues and push up fixes:
  - Fix merge conflicts.
  - Always run linters, type checkers, formatters, and unit tests before pushing up changes.
  - Fix code for minor nit comments, reply to comment, and resolve the discussion.
  - For PR comments that are generated by AI: determine if the change is warranted, avoid scope creep, reply to comment, and resolve the discussion.
  - When replying to PR review comments, use the review comment reply endpoint (NOT the issue comments endpoint):
    ```bash
    # Get review comment IDs (note the "id" field for REST and "node_id" for GraphQL)
    gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments --jq '.[] | {id, node_id, body: .body[:80]}'

    # Reply to a specific review comment thread
    gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies -f body="Your reply"

    # Resolve the review thread (use the node_id from the comment)
    gh api graphql -f query='mutation { resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "NODE_ID"}) { thread { isResolved } } }'
    ```
    WRONG: `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/NUMBER/comments` (this posts a top-level PR comment, not a thread reply)
4. Provide a list of all my PRs and their current status. Categorize the PRs into three sections with headers: Waiting on CI, Waiting on Review, Waiting on Me. Each PR should have an entry like:
  ```
  Title: <title>
  Link: <link-to-pr>
  Fix: <what-was-done-if-anything>
  Status: <status>
  Action: <what-to-do-next>
  ```
