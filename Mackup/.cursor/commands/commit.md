## Goals
Create a git commit after reviewing local changes, using a concise, high-signal message focused on **why** the change was made.

## Procedure
1. Run `git status` to understand the current state.
2. Read relevant files to determine a good commit message.
4. Add, commit, and push all changes with the custom git command: `git save --message "<message>" --yes`
