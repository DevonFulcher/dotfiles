1. Run `git status` to understand the current state.
2. Use `git diff` (and open files only as needed) to understand the change(s).
  - Do **not** run `git log` unless explicitly requested.
3. Determine a concise, plain commit message (no prefixes like `docs(...)`) focused on **why** the change was made.
4. Run `git save --message "<message>" --yes` which will add all changes, commit, and push.
