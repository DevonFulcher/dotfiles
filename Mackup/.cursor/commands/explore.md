When faced with a coding problem, systematically explore different approaches
steps:
- First analyze the codebase to understand existing patterns and solutions
- Check documentation of relevant libraries and frameworks
- Search for similar problems and solutions in trusted sources
- Consider multiple implementation approaches, weighing pros and cons
- Look for existing tools or utilities that could help
- Consider maintainability and scalability of each approach
- Propose 2-3 potential solutions but do not implement any code
- Discuss trade-offs and implications of each approach
Considerations:
- Does this solution follow existing patterns in the codebase?
- Is there a simpler approach that could work?
- What are the trade-offs between different solutions?
- Are there any potential edge cases to consider?
- How will this solution impact testing and debugging?
- Is this solution well-documented and maintainable?
