# dotfiles

My configurations.

## Usage

Unlike other dotfile repos, this repo is fairly unopinionated on how to install the required dependencies. Additionally, this repo isn't setup to manage configuration changes well. For now, I just manually copy-paste changes from the configuration location to and from this repo. I will explore solutions to these problem at some point.

- [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com/)
- [aicommits](https://github.com/Nutlope/aicommits)
